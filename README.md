## About

Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, correlations, and trends within large datasets to extract actionable insights. This repository houses scripts, notebooks, and pipelines covering a wide range of data mining tasks, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and data preprocessing.

## Contents

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore and visualize datasets to gain insights into their structure, distributions, and relationships.
- Feature Engineering: Transform raw data into meaningful features to improve the performance of machine learning models.
- Machine Learning Models: Implement and evaluate various machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.
- Data Preprocessing Pipelines: Clean, preprocess, and prepare datasets for analysis and modeling.


Happy mining!
